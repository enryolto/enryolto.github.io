My small collection of Digital Art that I created on a computer to replicate what I used to do on paper long time ago.

You can find the same on my Instagram profile [@black.and.white.patterns](https://instagram.com/black.and.white.patterns).

I also have some interesting posts saved on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.it/enryolto/).

They have some elements of [Op Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op_art) and [Zentangles](https://zentangle.com/).
