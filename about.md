*Who am I?*

I have a day (and sometimes night also...) job as a Project Manager.

At the same time I have a long standing passion for technology, in several forms. To name a few:
- 👨🏻‍💻 Software Development (e.g. [Parole Vincenti](https://parole-vincenti.web.app) web app *in italian*)
- 🌎 Internet and Digital
- 🎨 Computer Graphics and Design

I also try to practice creativity as a way to fight against fatigue from [Information Overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload), so I enjoy:
- 📸 **Photography** (you can have a look at my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/enryolto), even if it is not updated for a long time)
- ✍🏻 **Drawing** (you can have a look at the [Black&White patterns](/black.and.white.patterns) page)

*Why did I create this site?*

Well, mainly for myself. Because I wanted to write something. And I also wanted to learn some new Tech - in this case [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). And I also wanted to move some pages I built in [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com) to a new platform.

Oh... I forgot to remind you that...
