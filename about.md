I have a day (and sometimes night also...) job as a Project Manager in a consulting company.

At the same time I have a long standing passion for technology, in several forms. To name a few:
- Computer Programming
- Internet and Digital
- Computer Graphics and Design

I also like to practice creativity as a way to fight against fatigue from [Information Overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload), so I enjoy:
- Photography
- Drawing

That's why I built a personal page hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Oh... I forgot to remind you that...

*It is still under construction.*
